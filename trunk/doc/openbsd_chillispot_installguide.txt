You'll need a minimum of 2 interfaces to get up & running.
The external interface needs to be setup with the relevant info (ip address, etc etc)
The internal interface (or the interface pepperspot is running on) doesn't need any setting applied 
apart from that it needs to be marked up & if its a wireless card it needs to be set to hostap mode & 
have a ssid assigned.

PF needs to be enabled aswell as the net.inet.ip.forwarding sysctl.
You'll also need to setup a SSL certificate for Apache to use.

Everything you need to get started is in {PREFIX}/share/pepperspot
You'll need to install a RADIUS server if you don't have one setup already.

Copy hotspotlogin.cgi from {PREFIX}/share/pepperspot to your cgi-bin directory
Copy pepperspot-pf.conf to /etc/pf.conf & edit the int & ext_if macros 
if you're using freeRADIUS  there is a sample dictionary file included which needs to be added 
to your master dictionary file.
Copy pepper.conf & pepper.ipup from {PREFIX}/share/pepperspot to /etc
& edit the dns, dhcpif, uamsecret & radiussecret options
Now edit the hotspotlogin.cgi file you copied to your cgi-bin directory earlier & uamsecret so that its the same as
the entry in your /etc/pepper.conf.

Now start pepperspot in debug mode & make sure your clients are able to connect & pepperspot is responding by issuing
pepper -fd 

If everything is working as it should add the following to your /etc/rc.local
if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/pepper ]; then
/usr/local/bin/pepper > /dev/null & echo -n ' pepperspot'
fi
